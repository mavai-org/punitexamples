# PUnit Examples

Example applications and probabilistic tests demonstrating the
[PUnit](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit) framework. The project models
realistic service contracts — an LLM-powered shopping assistant and a payment gateway
with SLA requirements — and shows how to apply statistical rigour at every
stage of the testing lifecycle.

For framework concepts and configuration details see the
[PUnit User Guide](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md).
The service contracts here are written in the contract-first style documented in
[Part 1: The Service Contract](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md#part-1-the-service-contract--the-shared-correctness-target).

## The declarative path — start here

The fastest way in is two YAML files and a one-line test — no builder
vocabulary, and in this example **no bindings code at all**. The worked
example lives in `src/test/java/org/mavai/punit/examples/declarative/`:

- **`shopping-basket.yaml`** (test resources, same package) — the claim:
  one thresholded criterion over a `json` view, judged per path.
- **`mavai-services.yaml`** — the service itself: a `language-model`
  type with a structured-output `response-schema:`, a temperature
  exploration, and a `prompt-engineer` optimization.
- **`ShoppingBasketDeclarativeTest.java`** — the test:
  `PUnit.declared().assertPasses();` (a bundled stub endpoint stands in
  for the model, so everything runs offline through the real punit-lm
  wire path, token usage included).

```bash
./gradlew mavaiCheck                                 # validate the pair, zero samples
./gradlew test --tests ShoppingBasketDeclarativeTest # the one-line test
./gradlew exp -Prun=ShoppingBasketExperiments        # explore + optimize
./gradlew punitReport                                # the pages, under build/reports/punit/
```

Artefacts land under `build/punit/explorations/` and
`build/punit/optimizations/` with `totalTokens`/`avgTokensPerSample` in
their cost blocks; `punitReport` draws the comparison pages from them
with the shared `mavai` renderer, which the plugin brings from Maven
Central — nothing to install — and the cost cells read "ms · tok".

A service can equally be a **code binding** — one annotated method in a
conventional `MavaiBindings` class beside the tests:

```java
class MavaiBindings {
    @Binding("basket-builder")
    Outcome<String> buildBasket(String instruction) { /* your call */ }
}
```

— the contract's `service:` key resolves against definitions first,
then bindings; nothing else changes.

When a claim outgrows the file, graduate: `./gradlew mavaiMaterialise`
emits the equivalent `ServiceContract` class under
`build/punit/materialised/` — the same criteria the file instantiated,
as Java source that is now yours. Copy it into the source tree, fill
the invocation stub and the TODOs, delete the YAML. Nothing
round-trips: from that moment the class is the contract, and the rest
of this repository shows that full-API style; see the user guide's
[declarative part](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md#the-declarative-surface--contracts-as-files)
for the format.

## Project structure

A standard single-module Gradle / Maven layout — no special wiring is required to use PUnit:

```
src/main/java/org/mavai/punit/examples/
  app/         Domain classes — shopping actions, payment gateway.
  lm/          The mock language model and the mock-or-real switch over punit-lm's public API.
  servicecontracts/    Service contract definitions (the contract-first authoring surface).
  sentinels/   Sentinel-deployable reliability classes.

src/test/java/org/mavai/punit/examples/
  app/                     Unit tests for the domain code.
  experiments/             EXPLORE, MEASURE, OPTIMIZE experiments.
  probabilistictests/      Probabilistic tests of the service contracts.
  integration/             Operational-flow integration tests.
  architecture/            ArchUnit rules.

src/test/resources/        Test fixtures + PUnit baseline files (see below).
```

The service contracts and sentinels live in `src/main/` rather than `src/test/` because the same classes must be deployable as a sentinel JAR (see [Part 10: Sentinels](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md#part-10-sentinels--production-time-execution) in the user guide). The test stack (`punit-report`, JUnit, AssertJ, ArchUnit) is `testImplementation`, so it stays out of the sentinel JAR's runtime classpath.

## Service contracts

### Shopping basket

An LLM translates natural-language instructions ("add 2 apples") into
structured JSON shopping actions. The service contract validates that the
response is non-blank, parses as valid JSON, and contains only actions
appropriate to a shopping context.

This service contract demonstrates covariates (model, temperature, time of day),
input cycling, budget management (token tracking), exception handling modes,
and pacing constraints.

### Payment gateway

A mock gateway processes card payments with configurable latency and failure
rates. The service contract asserts both functional correctness (transaction
succeeds) and temporal compliance (completes within the SLA threshold).

This service contract demonstrates latency testing (p50, p90, p95, p99 percentiles),
warmup, test intent (smoke vs verification), and threshold origin documentation.

## Running

```bash
# Compile
./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava

# Run tests (some failures are expected — see note below)
./gradlew test

# Render the verdict report with the family's shared mavai renderer
# (https://github.com/mavai-org/mavai/releases)
mavai verdict build/reports/punit -o build/reports/punit/verdict.html
```

Many tests are **expected to fail at the sample level**. PUnit determines
pass/fail from the aggregate pass rate, not from individual samples. A test
run with sample-level failures does not indicate a broken build. The key
compatibility indicator is successful compilation.

## Experiments

PUnit's experiment types map to stages in a testing workflow:

| Stage    | Gradle task              | What it does                                           |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Explore  | `./gradlew flowExplore`  | Compares configurations (models, prompts) side by side |
| Optimize | `./gradlew flowOptimize` | Auto-tunes parameters (temperature, prompt text)       |
| Measure  | `./gradlew flowMeasure`  | Establishes an empirical baseline from 1000+ samples   |
| Test     | `./gradlew flowTest`     | Runs a probabilistic test against the baseline         |

To run the full flow end to end:

```bash
./gradlew operationalFlowTest
```

This executes explore → optimize → measure → verify → test in sequence and
validates the artifacts produced at each stage.

## Baselines

Measure experiments produce YAML **baseline files** — the empirical record of observed behaviour (pass rate, sample count, latency distribution) from which probabilistic tests derive their thresholds. Earlier docs called these files "specs" or "baseline specs"; the terms name the same artefact, and *baseline file* is the current one. In a real project baseline files are committed and consumed by probabilistic tests in CI.

In this project the generated baseline files under `src/test/resources/punit/baselines/` are gitignored because they regenerate frequently during development. Committed reference copies are in `src/test/resources/punit/specs-reference/` — see the [README](src/test/resources/punit/baselines/README.md) in the baselines directory for details.

## PUnit dependency

The project uses Gradle composite builds (`settings.gradle.kts`) to
automatically substitute the local `../punit` source when available. The
declared version in `build.gradle.kts` is only used when the local checkout
is absent. This means you can develop punit and punitexamples side by side
without publishing intermediate artifacts.

## Language-model mode

Every language-model call the examples make goes through punit-lm's public API (`org.mavai.punit.lm.api`); the examples carry no HTTP client of their own. The switch is `punit.llm.mode` (system property) or `PUNIT_LLM_MODE` (environment variable):

- `mock` (default): the examples' own `MockLanguageModel`, offline, no keys, temperature-dependent failures, token usage estimated — every experiment and test runs from a fresh clone.
- `real`: punit-lm configures a real provider from the model name (`claude-*` to Anthropic, everything else to OpenAI) and reads the credential the way a services file would — `MAVAI_LLM_API_KEY`, else `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Real mode costs money; the measure experiment runs 1000 samples by default.

```bash
PUNIT_LLM_MODE=real OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ./gradlew test --tests '*ShoppingBasket*'
```

Mock and real runs never share a baseline: the model states its configuration as covariates, and the mock states itself as `provider: mock`.

## Documentation

The **[PUnit User Guide](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit/blob/main/docs/USER-GUIDE.md)** is the comprehensive reference for the framework. It covers the full experimentation-to-testing workflow, the service contract pattern, latency assertions, budget and pacing control, the statistical core, the Sentinel runtime, and rendering reports with the shared `mavai` tool.

The **[Statistical Companion](https://github.com/mavai-org/punit/blob/main/docs/STATISTICAL-COMPANION.md)** covers the mathematical foundations for readers who want to understand the inference machinery.
